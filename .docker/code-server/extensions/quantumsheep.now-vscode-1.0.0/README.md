## How to install in Visual Studio Code
**You need to have the Now CLI (see https://zeit.co/now#get-started) and be logged in.**

Open the command palette with <kbd>F1</kbd> and type `ext install Now`.  
**OR**  
Go to extensions tab and search for `Now`.


## How to use
When the extension is installed, you can see a new activities bar tabs with the Now logo. In this tab you will have some options (deploying, refreshing, opening or removing your apps). To deploy an application, you need to have your working directory opened in VSCode, after that only a click on the rocket's icon would deploy your application.
